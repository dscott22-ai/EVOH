                <h2> History of HTTP</h2>
                <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) originated in the early 1990s as the foundational protocol for web communication. It was developed as part of a project leb ny Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to enable the exchange of hypertext documents on the World Wide Web.</p>
                
                <p>The original version, HTTP/0.9, was extremely simple and onlu spported raw HTML text. With no headers or status codes, it was essntially a one-way transmission method from a server to a browser. As the web quickly evolved, the limitations of this version became evident.</p>
                
                <p>HTTP/1.0 introduced headers,enabling metadata transmission, status codes, and content negotiation. This marked a majopr leap toward a more funtional web. Then,Http/1.1 still in wide use today:
                    ;brought improvements like presistent connections,chunked transfers, and better caching mechanisms. It significantly enhanced performance and efficiency across the internet.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Evolution continued with HTTP/2, which improved speed through multiplexing and header compression. Most recently, HTTP/3 was introduced, using QUIC instead of TCP for even faster and more secure connections, setting a new standard for web communication.</p>
