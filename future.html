      <h2>The Future of HTTP</h2>
      <p>The future of HTTP is poised to bring even more advancements in speed, security, and efficiency. As web technologies continue to evolve, HTTP will likely integrate more deeply with emerging protocols and standards to meet the demands of modern applications.</p>

      <p>HTTP/3, built on the QUIC transport protocol developed by Google, represents a major leap in addressing latency and connection reliability. Unlike HTTP/2, HTTP/3 eliminates the need for TCP handshakes by using UDP, drastically reducing page load times.</p>

      <p>One area of focus is enhancing security features to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This includes further adoption of HTTPS and improvements in encryption methods.</p>

      <p>Additionally, as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands, HTTP may adapt to better support the unique requirements of connected devices, ensuring seamless communication and data exchange.</p>
